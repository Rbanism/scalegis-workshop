## Setup instructions

In preparation to the Scalable GIS workshop on Monday, please carry out the setup instructions from the following link: [https://github.com/RS-DAT/2023-05-22-scalable-GIS/blob/main/setup.md](https://github.com/RS-DAT/2023-05-22-scalable-GIS/blob/main/setup.md). Although you will make use of SURF infrastructure and work in [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) in your web browser, you still need to have your computer set up according to those instructions. If you encounter issues with the setup, please come to the workshop at 9:00. We will be there to help you with that until 9:30 when the workshop starts.
